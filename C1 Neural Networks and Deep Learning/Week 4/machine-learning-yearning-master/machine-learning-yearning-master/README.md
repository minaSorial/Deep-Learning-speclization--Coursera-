### About

The book has been divided into 13 parts originally by _**Prof. Andrew NG**_ along with the complete book with all the parts consolidated. In this book you will learn how to align on ML strategies in a team setting, as well as how to set up development (dev) sets and test sets. Recommendations for how to set up dev/test sets have been changing as Machine Learning is moving toward bigger datasets, and this explains how you should do it for modern ML projects.
